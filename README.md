draftter
========

About
-----
`draftter` is a self-contained, single-page app for storing drafts of tweets. Everything in `draffter` is done client-side, so your tweets aren't stored or sent anywhere you don't want them to be.


Installation
------------
Installing `draftter` is incredibly simple. There's no database or any dynamic code, so installing it is as easy as downloading the code and throwing it into any web-accessible folder. That's all there is to it.

`draftter` is a Sunday afternoon time-waster by [Bill Israel](http://billisrael.info/), and uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/), although neither is really necessary.
